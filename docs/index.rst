Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live/continuous data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to file systems, databases.

In this article, I will explain about sending the events to Event Hubs in Azure using .NET framework.
